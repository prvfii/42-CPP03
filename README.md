    Understanding inheritance and polymorphism in C++.

_____________________________________________________________

Description

CPP Module 03 is the fourth project in the 42 C++ Piscine series. This module focuses on object-oriented programming principles, specifically inheritance and polymorphism. You will learn how to create hierarchies of classes and implement dynamic behavior based on object types.

This project builds a strong foundation for working with advanced C++ concepts like virtual functions, abstract classes, and runtime polymorphism.

Topics Covered

	•	Inheritance:
	•	Understanding base and derived classes.
	•	Using protected and private access specifiers.
	•	Polymorphism:
	•	Overriding functions in derived classes.
	•	Using virtual functions for runtime behavior.
	•	Abstract Classes:
	•	Defining interfaces using pure virtual functions.
	•	Preventing instantiation of abstract classes.
	•	Constructors and Destructors:
	•	Proper initialization and destruction in class hierarchies.
	•	Using virtual destructors.
